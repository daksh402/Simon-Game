# Simon Game

A web-based memory game inspired by the classic Simon electronic game. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (with jQuery)**, this project challenges the player's memory by generating a growing sequence of colors and sounds that must be repeated in the correct order.

## How to Play

- Press any key to start the game.
- Watch the color buttons light up and listen to their associated sounds.
- Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.
- A new color is added to the sequence with each level.
- If a wrong button is clicked, the game ends and a restart prompt appears.

## Features

- Dynamic level progression
- Button animations and sound effects
- Game-over screen with feedback
- Sequence comparison logic
- Easy restart functionality

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – For structure
- **CSS** – For styling and transitions
- **JavaScript** – Core game logic
- **jQuery** – DOM manipulation and event handling
- **Audio** – For feedback and sound effects
